# WeatherApp
> Fetches weather by current location or chosen location

WeatherApp uses LocationManager to grab current locaiton data, and networks with Open Weather Api to collect data. Also user can query weather based on city name. Be sure to spell it right; otherwise the Api will not recogize it. 

**Note: Some abbreviation cannot be used for cities, while others can. It is better to write out the whole city name.**
